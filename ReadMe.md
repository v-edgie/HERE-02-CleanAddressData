## Description
The HERE Geocoding and Search API receives a list of addresses to clean up and then responds with a list of potential addresses and a “score” which indicates how confident the HERE Geocoding and Search API is about the address. 

Scores range from 0-100% where 100% is an exact match to the input and correct address. 

For some industries, a score lower than 90% is not good enough, while in other industries a score of 70% and higher will suffice.

## Steps

1. create index.html, main.js, and style.css
1. replace API key in main.js
1. open index.html in abrowser
1. Submit the addresses
1. Experiment with other addreses
